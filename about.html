		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
		I am a competitive person and I work hard, but I still am not boring. My parents have raised me to be motivated to everything I do, so I’ll do my best. 
		I am not the most outgoing person, but I certainly respect other people and get along with everybody. Some soft skills like time management, leadership and teamwork come free with me. </br></br>
		
		My greatest strength is problem solving. I often think logically, but when I can't find the simple solution, I think out of the box. 
		I learn things fast and apply those in real life, especially I can solve real-world problems with computer science. Nowadays, I have learned multiple machine learning methods 
		and mathematical modeling – Those are great tools for software analytics, automated testing and research. </br></br>
		
		My next dream is to work abroad – that will happen in 2019. My interests are programming and scientific research. I have a few publications, which are available. 
		Even though, I program quite a lot for school and do my own projects, I do not share those easily. There might be just a couple of projects in my Github

		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>Programming, Strategy games, Board Games - These are the things I do almost every day.
		</br></br>
		I like to play floorball once a week. Sometimes I go play disc golf to the Hervanta course. I have tried out about 30 different disc golf courses in Finland.</p>

		<h3>Causes I care</h3>
		<p>
		Human rights - I am not "an activist", but I prefer equal rights to all individuals.</br></br>
		Children - Who wouldn't care about children? In few years, I would like to have a new family.
		That means the world should be safe and fair place for everyone. I will try to raise my future kids well.

		<h3>Top 3 Experiences</h3>
		<h4>ECSM</h4>
		<p>
		I cannot even describe how amazing the whole experience was. It was my first time to go and stay in a foreign country over a day.
		The first evening was marvellous with highly educated people from Poland, UK, Finland and South Africa. After that, the whole conference went great.
		I liked almost all of the presentations - one of those were the best I've ever seen. My presentation (both poster and paper) was great.
		At the end of the conference, I received an award for best poster. That crowned everything.

		<h4>Climbing on top of Halti</h4>
		<p>
		A few days before our trip to Halti, I crashed with my bicycle in the forest. Usually, I am not clumsy, but that just 
		happened - No serious injuries (and pain is just a feeling, right?). During that trip, I went to one of my friend's wedding. We drove to the Norway side of
		the Halti and climbed about 6 hours to the top of the highest mountain in Finland. 80 percent of the trip had
		awful lot of rocks and boulders. We moved slowly and I didn't even realize risks before we climber over the toughest spot. We managed to
		climb on top and took a few pictures. Then we got back ... slowly, but surely.
		</p>

		<h4>End of the Military Service</h4>
		<p>
		The first two months were quite hard in the military. It was not mentally hard, but physically. I was not the superman, that 
		I should have been. I adapted quickly, though. Säkylä taught me discipline and I kept my opinions about efficiency
		by myself. After the training period in Säkylä, I was 7 months in Riihimäki. In Riihimäki I was a researcher and a programmer.
		My time there was a lot easier. Before military service, I was afraid I would see some stupid people in Säkylä. That was not the case.
		My roommates were great guys. I expected a lot from Riihimäki and I was satisfied: The people were smart and friendly.
		I liked to be there a lot. It was surprisingly rewarding for me, as I got new friends, amazing experiences, work experience, etc.

		<h3>Top 3 Courses I have attended</h3>
		<h4>Speech Communication and Negotiation Skills</h4>
		<p>
		<b>in Finnish: Puheviestintä ja Neuvottelutaito</b>
		</br>
		The course was probably the best I have attended. I took it a few years ago and I noticed it changed my mindset.
		The first session, which had an introduction task, was the day when I decided not to be shy anymore. 
		I kinda manipulated myself to be something more, like some talented speaker. It worked. I was a 
		great presentator - Obviously, I have learned a lot and now I probably am even better one. 
		After those first few lessons, I have been practising social skills on a daily basis.
		I feel joy, when I discuss with new individuals - that is something I really enjoy.
		</p>
		<h4>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</h4>
		<p>
		The introduction course was already amazing. It taught me so much about machine learning.
		The thing what makes this special is the difficulty. This is like one of the hardest courses 
		in Tampere University. If I master all the things, I would be a great machine learning programmer.
		I totally like the subject. The motivation is high and I work hard to learn - actually learn.
		</p>
		<h4>Bachelor's Thesis</h4>
		<p>
		<b>in Finnish: Kandidaatintyö</b>
		</br>
		While I wrote my Bachelor's thesis, I was happy. The subject was about social isolation. It was my 
		idea, but I got the inspiration from Finnish Presidential candidates. I wanted to help people with an actual
		solution. I have never been the person, who just complains and does nothing about a thing. This is a 
		proof of that. I find solutions to real-world problems. I apply computer science, statistics, 
		mathematics and machine learning into any case and poof... there might be something to report.

		<h3>Top 3 Movies</h3>
		<h4>Gladiator (2000)</h4>
		<p>
		The movie resembles a true hero. It closely resembles of my actions, in similar circumstances.
		If someone would turn against me and kill my family - Is the way of revenge the correct way?
		I should watch the movie again, because the loyalty is one of the most important things I value.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Kingdom of Heaven (2005)</h4>
		<p>
		Great movie! Would you try to be a noble by your heart in any circumstances?
		Do you believe the actions speak louder than words? I at least believe so. Anyone could twist my 
		words and take those out of the context. That way I would be such a monster, I never want to be.
		</p>

		<h4>The Terminal (2004)</h4>
		<p>
		I found this movie extremely funny. I was also emotional, which was weird. The way someone 
		tries to achieve their dreams is mesmorizing. The main character helps other people, is friendly 
		and works extremely hard. He even turns the situation from bad to great.
		</p>

		<h3>Top 3 Songs</h3>
		<h4>Nightwish - Walking in the Air (1998)</h4>
		<p>
		The song combines extremely great singer with amazing music. The story of our life will go by fast, 
		if we lived in the world of "make-believe". In your dreams, you can be anything - even fly with the Snowman to the North Pole.
		</p>
		<h4>The Cranberries - Zombie (1995)</h4>
		<p>
		In my opinion, the song does not only resemble the effects of IRA bombing, it resembles the effects of war. 
		The location can be Africa, Middle East or any place. The truth is that all wars cause physical amd mental 
		damage to a lot of people. Even though you are not damaged physically at war, a lot of those soldiers and 
		civilians are like zombies. - No way of returning back to the positive person they were.
		</p>
		<h4>Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody (1975)</h4>
		<p>
		First of all, the singer has amazing vocal range. Secondly, the song is emotional. In my opinion, it resembles 
		the mental issues of a person, who has lived a life of a roller-coaster. It is about history, family and 
		religion. The person would want to leave, but it is not always possible. In the end, nothing really matters.
