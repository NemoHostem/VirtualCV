	My main task was to do my Bachelor's thesis there. I completed that in one month, so I had a lot of time for many other tasks.
	I prepared well for the ECSM conference, where I presented our team's scientific work and my poster. I got the best poster award, which was great.
	Other tasks in FDRA included UI design, teamwork, team management and, of course, a lot of programming with Python, JavaScript, Matlab and C++</p>
